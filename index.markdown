	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages. This is a proof of concept.</p>
	<p>I hope to use this site to host my education journey and perhaps a little blog about my family.</p>
	<p>I'm going to keep a running log of classes, books, or online courses that I have attempted/completed/abandoned [here.][courses]
