<h1>Hello World</h1>

I hope to use this site to host my education journey and perhaps a little blog about my family.

I'm going to keep a running log of classes, books, or online courses that I have attempted/completed/abandoned [here.](./courses/)

Below, you will see a list of blog posts.  This website is limited to static display and can't support any dynamic graphics or interfaces.  I will see how appealing it can be without all the fancy pants doodads.
