As I begin this site, it's probably best to recap what I have done in the last couple weeks.

I already have a bachelor of science from Florida State Univeristy in a non-computer science field.  I don't have any interest in getting another bachelors degree.  If I were to continue my education, I would like to get a master's degree.  I applied to the Master of [Cyber Security program at the University of West Florida][cyber-security] and was offered a conditional admission. This was conditioned on my satisfactory completion of a prerequisite Python programming course.  

I tried to get signed up for that course but by the time I MIGHT have been able to get into it, the course had already been going on for a week.  Instead I contacted a few friends who were in the IT field to ask for advice.  Their advice was unanimously: "Skip the degree and just keep learning on your own."

I started looking for online programs and stumbled into edX.  I found a [computer science track][edX] which doled out the essentials of a CS bachelor's degree.  I'm currently 3 weeks into that course and finding spare time in between content releases to learn how to make this site.  I've also been dabbling in machine learning, just to wrap my head around the possiblities.  I don't feel like I'm at a point to start developing any artificial intelligence.

I'll get the next week of material tomorrow at 10am.  I hope to update this site when I complete that next chunk of work.
