I am playing with the notion to journal my journey thru self-education as a developer.  I intend to maintain a page which lists each book or 
course that I attempt/complete in my quest to be employable as a developer.  

Now, as a "developer" I'm not sure what my end goal will be.  I have always been a person who is resistant to hiring jobs out, whether that 
job is installing a sprinkler system in my lawn, rebuilding a truck, or building a quadcopter.  My plan is to simply learn as much as I can 
about the things that interest me, until I reach a point where someone may want to pay me for my skills.

I already have a fruitful career, but I don't appreciate the feeling of comptempt that has developed for my profession or the direction that 
the field has moved in overall.  I would like to make myself more marketable in a broader sense.

Anyway, this will be my long-form resume.  It may include my milestones, complaints, musings, or whatever else I may want to put out there.

For now, I aim to learn how to integrate Jekyll to the github pages.  At the moment, I am having trouble getting github pages to recognize 
the index.html file that is buried in a subfolder. . .
