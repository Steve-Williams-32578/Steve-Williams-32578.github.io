title: "Courses I'm Working Thru"
permalink: ./courses/

I began my journey with Beginning C# 7 with Visual Studio 2017.  This book was an excellent introduction but I became very frustrated half way thru with
repeated typographical errors.  

I then started concurrently working thru Project Euler and HackerRank.

I have also gone thru courses on Udemy.com: 
  Total: CompTIA A+ Certification(220-1001)
  Total: CompTIA A+ Certification(220-1002)
  The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp
  
All of 3 of these course were enjoyable but also the started at very slow paces. 

Currently, I am working thru an edX XSeries Program, Computer Science:
  Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python - This is a weekly course offered by MIT professor Eric Grimson, who is a great professor.
